### Mini Game

- Game Flow: You use useState to manage the game state, including the user's selected number (userNumber), the game-over status (gameIsOver), 
and the number of guess rounds (guessRounds).

- Functions like pickedNumberHandler start the game, gameOverHandler handles the game-over event, and startNewGameHandler resets the game for a new round.
Screens: Based on the game state, different screens (StartGameScreen, GameScreen, GameOverScreen) are shown. You switch between them dynamically depending 
on whether the user has picked a number or the game is over.

- NumberContainer: Displays the chosen number with stylized borders and text.
- Title: Styled text for displaying headings, like titles.
- Styling: Youâ€™ve applied StyleSheet for component layout and design, using properties like flex, padding, and color constants imported from colors.js.
- Image Background: You use ImageBackground to add a background image to the game interface, with adjustable opacity for styling.
